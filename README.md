youtube video auto upload using selenium with python


Note: Use accounts that do not have two-factor authentication.

I have added up to 10+ auto likes and subs. If you want more, copy lines 216 to 237 and paste them in line 239. Don't forget to replace the email and password.

If you only want auto likes and don't want auto subscribers,

remove the line containing the subscribe xpath: driver.find_element_by_xpath('/html/body/ytd-app/div[1]/ytd-page-manager/ytd-watch-flexy/div[5]/div[1]/div/div[2]/ytd-watch-metadata/div/div[2]/div[1]/div/ytd-subscribe-button-renderer/yt-button-shape/button/yt-touch-feedback-shape/div/div[2]').click()

Change the URL in url.txt to your required video link.

After downloading the folder, extract it and open cmd. Enter "python" to find your Python version. Then, enter "pip install undetected_chromedriver" in the cmd.

After downloading the chromedriver (https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads), extract it to the downloaded folder and ensure that it matches the chrome version of your PC. Finally, enter "multi.py" or "multi" in the cmd or Python idle
